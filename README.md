<p align="center">Docker image for node application with ImageMagick preinstalled</p>


This image is based on [node:lts-alpine](https://hub.docker.com/_/node) and installs the latest version of [ImageMagick](https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick) with LQR.


The main purpose is just to provide a reusable base image for applications I develop in Node that require ImageMagick with LQR.
